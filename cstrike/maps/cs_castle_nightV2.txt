Castle Night - Hostage Rescue
by Kampy (Kampy@20gmx.de)

There is a castle which is used 
as headquater for a group of 
terrorists. They took 3 hostages.

Counter-Terrorists:  
Get inside the castle and rescue 
the three hostages or just kill
all terrorists.

Terrorists: 
Your mission is to save your
headquater - dont let the hostages
leave the castle!

Other Notes: 
- counter-terrorists can climb the
  crates in their base (up the roof)
- do not shoot the moon!
